# UNet-Plus-Plus-Segmention-with-mobilenetv3
Using Unet architecture as decoder and MobileNet V3 as encoder
The official code for ["Covid-19 CT scans dataset_"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/mosmed-covid19-ct-scans).

## How to use
first download models and save them in same directory with IPYNB file as jupyter notebooks.
## Encoders and Decoders
encoder Architecture is Unet++ based on [segmentation_models.pytorch](https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models.pytorch/tree/master/segmentation_models_pytorch).
also we can use other Architecture such as Unet, PspNet, FPN, MaNet, LinkNet, Pan and others..
for decoder we can use all the Architecture such as Mobilenet V1,v2,V3- ResNet 18,34,50,101,152- VGG 11,16,19- EfficientNet B0,B1,B2,B3,B4,B5,B6,B7- Xception and others..
